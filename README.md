# My Programming Journey 🚀

A repository to document my learning journey into the world of programming for Hack Club's Summer of Making 2025. I'm starting with C and plan to expand to Python, SQL, and more!

## 👋 About This Project

This project is more than just a collection of code; it's a living diary of my adventure into computer science. My goal for this summer is to build a strong, versatile programming toolkit, one language at a time.

I'm starting with **C** to understand the fundamental principles of memory, pointers, and how computers work at a low level. From there, I plan to explore:
*   **Python:** To learn about rapid development, web applications, and data science.
*   **SQL:** To master the language of databases and data management.

This repository will contain all my notes, practice exercises, and small projects for each language.

## 📂 Project Structure

All my work is organized into language-specific folders to keep things tidy:

*   `/c` - My exercises and small projects written in C.
*   `/python` - My future scripts and projects in Python.
*   `/sql` - My practice queries and database schemas.

## 🎯 My Learning Goals

*   [x] **C:** Master fundamentals like pointers, memory management (`malloc`/`free`), and data structures.
*   [ ] **Python:** Learn object-oriented programming and build a simple web scraper or API.
*   [ ] **SQL:** Understand relational databases and write complex queries to analyze data.

## 🚀 Demos & Highlights

Here are a few highlights from my journey so far.

#### C Language: Simple Calculator
*   **Description:** A command-line calculator that can perform basic arithmetic. This was my first "real" project where I had to combine multiple concepts.
